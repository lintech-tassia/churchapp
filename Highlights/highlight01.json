As part of God’s remnant church in this world, we are equally poised at maintaining our focus on Christ and His Second Coming. Even the whole world knows that our profession of keeping the commandment of God and hold the testimony of Jesus Christ throws us into the colosseum of truth leaving us increasingly vulnerable in this cosmic controversy. Surely, in this volatile spiritual contest that we have been called, torturing and tutoring it is yet there is still hope. Christ has promised that “all powers have been given to him”(Matt. 28:18,20) and also He is with us always until the end of time. This assurance is the spur we possess to enable us endure to the end, for our salvation (Matt. 24:13).."
