It is a call to mobilize our resources efficiently and productively, to be flexible, and to answer God's call to put aside our own plans and move in whatever direction He calls us to go.\r\n\r\n Women's Ministries embraces the Seventh-day Adventist Church's 2020-2025 world theme—I Will Go. We have added to it three words, REACH MY WORLD, and it becomes I Will Go Reach My World."
